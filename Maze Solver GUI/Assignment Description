The Mines of Moria
For simplicity, imagine Moria as a 2D array of integers (a maze).
The maze has a defined start and end point

This assignment has two parts!

Use an enum Cell to represent the maze's properties: WALL = 0, PATH = 1, TRACK = 2.
Maze input: The program accepts a maze in the form of a 2D array.
Recursive function: Write a recursive method named findPath() that navigates the maze from the start point to the end point.
Path tracking: findPath() should mark the path it has taken. If findPath() hits a dead end (no more open paths), print an error message.
Output: Once a path is found or if no path is possible, the program should display the maze with the path marked. If no path is found, it should indicate so.
Translate this game to a simple GUI (you may use the JPanel below) and add your own customizations.
Comments and documentation: Include comments explaining your code and the logic behind your recursive method.
