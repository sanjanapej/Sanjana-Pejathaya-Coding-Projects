Problem Statement
Background Story
You are attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
After you got yourself into some unfortunate business with Peeves (a poltergeist whose sole existence causes mischief and chaos) and a suit of armor, Professor Lockhart, the current Defense against the Dark Arts professor has given you detention and asked you to oversee a dueling event - as he needs to answer some urgent fan mail and cannot supervise the students himself.
Harry Potter and Hermione Granger are eager to practice some defense spells and are the first students to show up.

Context
Duelers can cast one of three spells:

Protego: Shield charm, protects the spell caster with an invisible shield that reflects spells.
Expelliarmus: Disarming charm, knocks the victim's weapon out of their hands.
Stupefy: Stunning spell, renders its target unconscious if the spell's impact is 10.
Logic
When a spell is cast, the strength of the spell determines the impact on the opponent.
The strength (impact) is measured on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 the least and 10 the most impact.
The impact is computed every time a spell is cast.
Each duel should involve at most six spells, this should be checked when determining the winner. If it involves more than six spells, the duel should be declared as invalid.
The winner of the duel is the dueler who was impacted the least and is not unconscious.
If a dueler is hit by a stunning spell (Stupefy) with an impact of 10, the opponent automatically wins.

Grade Earned: 24/25
