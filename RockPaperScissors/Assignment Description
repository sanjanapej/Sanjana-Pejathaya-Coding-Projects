Problem
Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock was invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla as a version of the classic selection method game Rock-Paper-Scissors that features two additional gestures: the lizard ðŸ¦Ž (hand as a sock-puppet-like mouth) and Spock ðŸ–– (Star Trek Vulcan salute).

It's very simple:
Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes Lizard, Lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates Lizard, Lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and (as it always has) rock crushes scissors.

The Game
The game allows a human player to play against a computer player.

One round is played as follows:
1. The human player chooses their gesture (type of Choice).
2. The computer player chooses a random gesture (type of Choice)
3. The program checks for a win, loss, or draw of the round.

The game is played "best of 3", meaning that a player needs to win at least two rounds to win the game.

Rules & Background
In the standard "rock-paper-scissors" gestures, each gesture defeats the one before it, and is defeated by the one after. 
If we add the two additional gestures after the word they 'rhyme' with, the order is determined as:
1. Rock
2. Spock
3. Paper
4. Lizard
5. Scissors

Hence, the following rules can be derived:

Scissors cut paper
Paper covers rock
Rock crushes lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes (or melts) scissors
Scissors decapitate lizard
Lizard eats paper
Paper disproves Spock
S vaporizes rock
Rock breaks scissors
Game Requirements - Code
There are TODOs in the code. Make sure to follow them!

RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock represents the game.
Each choice should do the following
getName(): Return a String with the choice's name (make use of GameChoices!)
determineWin(otherPlayerChoice): compares the choice with the other player's choice
Should return an int:
0: choice is equal to otherPlayerChoice
1: choice wins agains otherPlayerChoice
-1: choice looses to otherPlayerChoice
competeExplanation(otherPlayerChoice): should return a String of the game round's explanation (e.g., "Lizard poisons Spock")
Input Validation & Error Handling: Make sure to add error and input validation checks!
